# gtfish27-markdown-render-link

A VSCode extension that enhances markdown rendering by adding support for backtick-wrapped URLs in links. 
This allows you to use special characters in URLs without worrying about markdown parsing conflicts.

```
Links in the form of [Google](`https://www.google.com`) will be considered as [Google](https://www.google.com)
```
